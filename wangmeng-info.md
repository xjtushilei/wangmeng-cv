**Projects**

*   Medical Knowledge Graph Construction, _03/2016-03/2017, The University of Queensland, Australia_

    Aiming to constructing a large and high-quality heterogeneous medical knowledge graph from electronic medical records. The medical knowledge graph provides a path way for effective treatment recommendations. The dataset [PDD](http%3A%2F%2Fkmap.xjtudlc.com%2Fpdd%2F) is accepted by ISWC 2017.

*   Answering Why/Why-Not Questions on SPARQL Queries, _03/2014-03/2016, Xi'an Jiaotong Universtiy, China_

    Formalized and proposed a why-not model to give explanations for both basic graph patterns and operations of SPARQL queries. Implemented a novel system ([ANNA](http%3A%2F%2Fkmap.xjtudlc.com%2Fanna%2F)) and demonstrated it in ISWC 2015.

*   Faceted Exploring Domain Knowledge over RDF data, _03/2013-03/2014, Xi'an Jiaotong Universtiy, China_

    Implemented a proposed faceted templates mining method that takes the topological features into the machine learning approach. Implemented a novel system ([KFM](http%3A%2F%2Fkmap.xjtudlc.com%2Fkfm%2F)) and demonstrated it in CIKM 2014.
